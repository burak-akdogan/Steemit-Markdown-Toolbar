# Markdown Toolbar for Textarea

This project adds a markdown toolbar to any `textarea` field on a webpage, allowing users to easily format text with common markdown syntax. The toolbar includes buttons for bold, italic, strikethrough, link insertion, image insertion, and more.

## Features
- Adds a floating toolbar above the `textarea` with buttons for formatting text in markdown.
- Supports common markdown elements like **Bold**, *Italic*, ~~Strikethrough~~, `Inline Code`, and code blocks.
- Handles various types of headers and lists.
- Automatically updates a hidden input element (if available) to keep the form submission consistent.
